# DataStructuresProject2
CPU Job Scheduling Simulator, implementation of a priority queue using a heap - December 2016

This project was done as part of the Data structures and Algorithm Course with my collegue Fatima Jabarti in December 2016

The project consists of five classes
  1. CS210Project2 -> Main class
  2. HeapPriorityQueue 
  3. Priority Queue
  4. Job -> simulates job requests as Job objects, where each object composes three data members 
  5. Schedular -> Simulating job schedulling mechanism
